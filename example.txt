Getting over it.
sometimes things are not as they appear. so you have to fake it till you make it.

there is no reason to be stuck in the loop that wont help you. just focuse on the future and what it might bring you.

sometimes u just never know how happy you can be, because if you will be really honest with yourself you werent happy.

the Person couldnt understand your Needs and was only pushing her, knowing how much u value her.

no matter what life brings next, changes are Always something good, you just must make yourself Ready for them.
